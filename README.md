# California Housing Price Prediction - Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates the practical implementation of **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**, and **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)** using the **California Housing dataset**.  
The main goal is to compare these regression techniques and understand the impact of regularization on model performance.
